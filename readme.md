## Threft application

The threft application is the user front-end for threft code generation. It allows .thrift parsing and code generation for officially supported code generators.

TODO: Test how submodule behaves in this.. i.e. submodule tidm here, and in gen-go, does that work? Probably wont work.

Imports gen-go, tidm, encoding/json, flags(?).
